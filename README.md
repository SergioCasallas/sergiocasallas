<p align="left">Hi! I’m a Full Stack Developer and, after four years immersed in this exciting world, I’m thrilled to build web applications that not only work but actually solve problems and improve people’s lives. My journey has allowed me to explore both frontend and backend, giving me a complete perspective on how to bring ideas to life from start to finish.<br><br>I firmly believe in the power of open, assertive communication to keep teams aligned. I enjoy every challenge that problem solving brings, and I move quickly to deliver value on an ongoing basis.<br><br>What truly drives me is seeing how software can be a powerful tool for others to achieve their goals. I feel incredibly fulfilled to be part of that growth journey. I’m here to connect with professionals and teams who share this same passion for innovation, hunger for growth, and determination to never stop learning and improving.</p>
